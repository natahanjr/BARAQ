"""Single-tenant deployment: the tenant-less API surface is **not yet gated**.

BARAQ is deployed as a **single-tenant** SOC platform. Most read paths carry an
``org`` column and are filtered per analyst (``tests/test_tenant.py``). The v2
surfaces and several secondary modules have **no org column at all** - there is
nothing to filter on - so today any authenticated analyst can read them.

This file is an **executable specification of that gap**, not a passing suite.

Status
------
The obvious fix - swapping ``require_auth`` for ``require_admin`` on those
routers - was implemented and then **reverted**, because it breaks the product.
Eight of these surfaces are called by analyst-facing pages with no role check:

| Surface | Called by |
|---|---|
| ``/api/bookmarks`` | ``Bookmarks.jsx`` |
| ``/api/compliance/export`` | ``ComplianceGap.jsx`` |
| ``/api/intel/feeds`` | ``Dashboard.jsx`` (non-admin path) |
| ``/api/insider-threat/scores`` | ``InsiderThreat.jsx`` |
| ``/api/ueba/baselines`` | ``UEBA.jsx`` |
| ``/api/detections`` | ``api.js`` (``detectionDetail``) |
| ``/api/evaluation/*`` | ``api.js`` (5 call sites) |
| ``/api/investigation/process-tree`` | ``api.js`` (``investigate``) |

Gating them returns 403 to every analyst and blanks those screens. Since this is
a single-tenant deployment there is no cross-tenant exposure to fix - the correct
resolution is one of:

1. Add an ``org`` column to the tenant-less tables and filter properly, or
2. Keep them analyst-accessible and state the single-tenant assumption
   explicitly in the deployment docs, or
3. Add a role gate **and** a matching role check in each calling component.

Until one of those is done, the assertions below are expected to fail. They are
kept in the suite deliberately: a silent pass would mean the gap had been closed
without anyone noticing.

If you are running the full suite and want these excluded until the decision is
made, deselect with::
